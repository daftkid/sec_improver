# Security Improver
This framework has been designed and developed for `studying purposes` only. I've implemented it as a practical part of my `master diploma work`.

## Overview
The framework is intended to improve level of security of information and data in the clouds like Amazon Web Services (AWS), MS Azure and so on.
All of the tools are implemented as Python programs.

Three main tools are included:
1. Tool for scanning and deleting outdated IAM Users' keys.
2. Tool for scanning and fixing widely open rules on Security Groups.
3. Tool for searching and destroying unused resources in particular cloud account.

More detailed information about each of the tools will be added a bit later. To be continued... 

## Usage
You should use Python3 for running all of the scripts in `python` directory.
